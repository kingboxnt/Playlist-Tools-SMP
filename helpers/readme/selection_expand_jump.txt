Replaces selection tools included on foo_menu_addons (known to crash):
https://hydrogenaud.io/index.php?topic=47332.0

Tools included:
	- Invert selection: inverts selection on current playlist.
	- Move selection to: moves (cut) current selection to another place 
	on current playlist or now playing playlist.
	- Expand: extends current selection according to TF expression or
	tag matching (for ex. select all tracks by same artists than the
	currently selected tracks).
	- Jump: moves cursor to next/previous track which doesn't match a
	TF expression or tag from selected tracks.
	
* Move Selection:
	- By delta value: shifts the current position of the selection by X
	value, which may be positive (down on the playlist) or negative 
	(up). If X would put the selection below 0 position or over the 
	current	playlist length, then the selection is shifted up to that
	point... i.e. no cycling. Note disjoint selections will remain
	disjoint while being displaced, unless	the first/last track is
	already at the top/bottom of the playlist, when the other tracks 
	will continue to be displaced until they are joined and can not be
	moved anymore.
	- To the middle: cuts current selection, finds the middle and then
	inserts	it at that place. Note disjoint selections become joint
	after insertion.
	- After playing now track: cuts current selection, finds the
	currently playing track (which may be at a different playlist) and
	then inserts the selection at that place. Note disjoint selections
	become joint after insertion.
	
* Expand Selection:
	- Tags: may be a single tag (%artist%) or a list of tags
	(%artist%;%title%).	Any other track from the current playlist 
	which matches at least one of those tags (compared against the 
	entire set of tags values from the current selection) will be 
	included in the	selection. The bigger the current selection, the
	weaker the matching conditions will be, since only a match is
	required. i.e. if you select 5 different artists, expand will 
	match any track from any of those 5 artists (not only tracks which
	have those 5 artists at the same time).
	- TF Expression: full fledged TF expressions may be used to find
	matches. This may be considered as the alternative to query 
	filtering (where output is selection instead of	a new playlist). 
	For ex. to select tracks with the same folder one level over the 
	current one $directory(%path%,2) may be used. Like tags, multiple 
	TF expressions	may be used too separated by ';'.
	
* Jump:
	- Uses the same logic than Expand Selection but stops as soon at it
	finds one track	not matching the condition. That will be the newly
	selected track (and focus is moved to that position).
