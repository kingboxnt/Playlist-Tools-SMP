Alternative to foo_playlist_revive.
Playlist Revive makes dead items in a playlist alive again by replacing
them with the matching ones in media library. A handy utility for those
who often move or rename their media files/folders.

Querying:
	- TITLE
	- AUDIOMD5 (tag from foo_md5 if found) (*)
	- MD5 (tag from foo_md5 if found) (*)

Matching (rules by order):
	- Audio MD5 (file info) (Exact Match) (*)
	- AUDIOMD5 (tag from foo_md5 if found) (Exact Match) (*)
	- MD5 (tag from foo_md5 if found) (Exact Match) (*) (**)
	- TITLE + Length + Size (Exact Match)
	- Tags (Similarity)

Usage:
	- Select the tracks in the relevant playlist.
	- Apply script (using a button, menu entry, main menu SMP, etc. 
	associated to it).
	- The tools allow to only replace with exact matches or by some 
	similarity threshold. 
	- 'Simulate' options just simulates the processing, does nothing
	but reporting you -planned- changes.
	- The console always reports the tracks changed and info, contrary
	to what foo_playlist_revive plugin did.

(*) Audio MD5 is a feature of some formats which store audio checksums as 
part of their file info. That's different, although similar, to a tag
named AUDIOMD5 (or MD5) by foo_md5 plugin.

On the first step -querying-, the tag is used if available (it's not a 
requisite). On the second step -matching-, the file info is used if
available (for some formats), if it's not found then it tries the tag
counterpart. If it's not found it tries the next rule, ...

(**) foo_md5 plugin lets you configure the tag name. I use those 2 as 
possible names to look for. Plugin can be found here:
https://foobar.hyv.fi/?view=foo_audiomd5
Note that for formats having CRC checks (like flac), you can also get an 
md5 tag with mass tagger scripts: $info(MD5) -> copy -> AUDIOMD5
You can find such preset at '.\presets\Masstagger'
