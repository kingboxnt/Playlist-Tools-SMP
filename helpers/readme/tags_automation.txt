Automatic tagging for selected tracks using multiple plugins:
- foo_biometric (FooID Fingerprinting).
- Chromaprint (ChromaPrint Fingerprinting).
- foo_masstag (copy native MD5 to tag).
- foo_audiomd5 (calculate audio MD5 from file).
- foo_rgscan (Replay Gain).
- foo_dynamic_range (DR).
- ffmpeg (EBUR 128 Scanner for LRA tag).

Dependencies:
Fooid plugin and binary file can be found at  '.\_resources' folder.
Chromaprint dependencies should be already included within this download.
ffmpeg feature requires to download 'ffmpeg.exe' from the web
and and place it into '.\helpers-external\ffmpeg\ffmpeg.exe'.
For any other component related feature (foo_***), the plugin needs
to be installed first by the user. Some may be available by default.

After (un)installing a dependency, a panel reload will be required.
