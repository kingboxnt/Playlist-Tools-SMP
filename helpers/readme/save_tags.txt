Utility to compare tags between 2 sets of tracks (sources).
It may be used to compare changes between backups and current library 
and/or apply tags from one source to another. For ex. you may apply 
current library tags to your backup, thus updating it, without having
to copy all files. 

Specially useful on local networks.

Usage:
- Send all tracks from Source A to a playlist:
	- Select source A tracks, and save its tags to a file.
- Send all tracks from Source B to a playlist:
	- Select source B tracks and compare against previously created tags
	file (Source A).
- On popups, you may replace root paths for comparing:
	- Source A may be at: H:\Music\...  ->  Root: 'H:\'
	- Source B may be at: D:\Backup\Music\...  ->  Root: 'D:\Backup\'
	- It's supposed that both sources directory trees -minus the root-
	are identical.
- Utility will report not matched files. i.e. files at B not present at A.
	- Comparison is asymmetrical. Files from A not present on B will not
	be reported, and just skipped.
	- If you want to report missing files in both directions, the perform
	comparison in 2 steps (A to B and B to A).
- Utility will report matched files with tag differences.
	- Tags from source A tracks may be applied to Source B tracks if
	desired.
	- Only files with differences will be edited (timestamps will remain
	the same for the rest).
