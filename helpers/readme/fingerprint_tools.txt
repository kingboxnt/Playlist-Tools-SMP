Button for all Fingerprint Tools: fingerprint search and tagging.

	-Search: Search the entire Foobar2000 library for tracks with
	similar fingerprint to the currently selected tracks. 

	-Tag: Tag the currently selected tracks with fingerprints.
	For Chromaprint, the raw fingerprint is saved, not the
	encoded version provided by default by fpcalc.exe or other
	software like MusisBrainz Picard. Also the entire file
	is fingerprinted, not just the first 120 secs.
	
	-Chromaprint database: Creates a reverse indexed database
	for faster lookups. Specially useful for large libraries.
	Requires to be recreated on library changes (automatically
	checked).
	
	-FooID tagging: requires 'foo_biometric' to be installed 
	on Foobar2000, 	along its 'Fooid.dll'. All files required
	can be found at '_resources', along installation notes.

FooID or Chromaprint versions available.

MOST CHROMAPRINT TOOLS ARE GREYED OUT DUE TO LIMITATIONS ON CURRENT
FOOBAR2000 AND SMP ENGINE.
