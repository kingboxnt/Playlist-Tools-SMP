Search n tracks (randomly) on library with the same style(s) than the
	current selected track.

Usage:
	- The number of output tracks may be set at properties panel. 
	- Forced query to pre-filter tracks may be set at properties panel.

NOTE: If you want to use arbitrary tags, use "search_same_by.js" instead.
